                I am a mathematician and software engineer based in Philadelphia. I completed my PhD at the University of Warwick in 2017 under the supervision of Samir Siksek. Since then,
                I held two postdoctoral positions &mdash; one at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany, and the other one at University
                College London &mdash; and I worked as a full stack software engineer at Enable for nearly two years. I moved to Philadelphia in October 2023
                and taught Calculus I during the Fall 2023 semester at Temple University.

                As a PhD student and a postdoc, I conducted research in arithmetic geometry, an area of mathematics that focuses on solving arithmetic problems using geometric arguments.
                You can find my publication list in the Research section of this website.
